# What is Storm Mode?

Storm Mode is a proposed section of the Florida Power and Light app that is displayed during a storm event. It provides predictive and real-time data to customers. Its design is simple yet powerful, providing users with helpful data during and before power outages.

# Design


Because FPL already had a mobile app, our team desided to integrate our design into NextEra Energy's pre-existing style guide. Utilizing consice infographics and color coding we were able to clearly comunicate the information to the end user. By being decisive with information shared we don't overwhelm the user and minimize the risk of overpromising.
